* C
    - Create a file at VS Code: code hello.c
    - Compile your code: make hello
    - Run your file: ./hello
    - Print a think in the console: printf("");
    - Ever file that ends with a .h is a header file, it cames with the language it self, basically a pre installed library
    - You can include libraries with the #include
    - To use printf, you need to include the stdio.h library
    - I can see the documentation of libraies in this link https://manual.cs50.io/
    - Use the cs50.h library to get user information using get_char, get_double, get_float, get_int, get_string, ...
    - To display a printf with a variable, we use %s\n: printf("Hello, %s\n", answer); It displays like this Hello, Martin
    - If you want to print a integer variable with a text, we don't use %s\n, we use %i\n, because the type it's int and not string
    - Variables in C need to have the type with their name, like: string answer
    - We use for and while for loops
    - Create functions with void: void meow(void) {}
    - Functions need to be declared before they`re called, but we can use prototypes to don`t need to create our function at the top
    - To use a prototype, we just call this at the top, with our function name and parameters: void meow(void);
    - We use the word const to set a variable to constant: const int n = 1;
    - Casting a type for a thing: float i = (float) x / y;
    - Floating point impresicion it`s a problem with impresicion with numbers who have longs digits after the , like 0,333333333333
