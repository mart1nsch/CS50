* Algorithms
    - O(n) = Linear Search
    - O(log n) = Binary Search

* Strings
    - We don't use == to compare strings
    - We will use the string.h library and the strcmp function to compare them
    - We can use it to do a binary search, because it returns a number as result of the comparision

* Data Structures
    - And object
    - The code is like that:
        + typedef struct
          {
              string name;
              string number;
          }
          person;
