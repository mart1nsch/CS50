* Algorithms
    - O(n) = Linear Search
    - O(log n) = Binary Search

* Strings
    - We don't use == to compare strings
    - We will use the string.h library and the strcmp function to compare them
    - We can use it to do a binary search, because it returns a number as result of the comparision

* Data Structures
    - And object
    - The code is like that:
        + typedef struct
          {
              string name;
              string number;
          }
          person;

* Recursion
    - Recursion is better than bouble sort and selection sort
    - We need to use our recursive function in a way that we first resolve the last numbers, exemple:
        + Here is a function that prints a pyramid starting to the top to bottom:
            # void draw(int height)
              {
                  if (height <= 0)
                  {
                      return;
                  }
  
                  draw(height - 1);
  
                  for (int i=0; i<height; i++)
                  {
                      printf("#");
                  }
                  printf("\n");
              }
        + It starts with, exemple, height 4 when it is called, and than it calls it back with draw(height - 1) until height is 1, and than starts printing

* Merge sort
    - It's the better sorting algorithm
    - It use recursion
    - We use recursion to sort every middle piece in littles pieces
    - It's like a tree
